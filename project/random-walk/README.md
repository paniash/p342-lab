# Introduction to random walks

`walker.py` contains helper functions for generating the random walks, as well as calculating the averages such as RMS distance, radial distance and average displacements along the x and y axes.

`main.py` generates 100 random walks for each N (5 in number) and plots 5 random walks for each N, hence generating a total of 5 graphs.

`averages.py` evaluates the RMS distance, radial distance and the average displacements along the x and y axes, for 100 walks for an N given by the user as input.

`rms-vs-rootn.py` plots the RMS distance as a function of N and it is observed that R_RMS varies as the square root of N.
