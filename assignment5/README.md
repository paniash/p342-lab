# Numerical Methods of solving for zeros of equations

## Question 1
In this section, we attempt to solve various equations using the following methods:
- Bisection
- Regula Falsi
- Newton Raphson

The data files for each method are present in their corresponding csv files. For example, bisection method of 1a is present in `bisection_a.csv` and so on.

**NOTE:** The convergence plots for 1a and 1b are stored in plot_1a.pdf and plot_1b.pdf respectively.

## Question 2
Using Laguerre's method and synthetic division, the roots of an 'n' degree polynomial are found.
