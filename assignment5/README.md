# Numerical Methods of solving equations

## Question 1
In this section, we attempt to solve various equations using the following methods:
- Bisection
- Regula Falsi
- Newton Raphson

**NOTE:** The plots for 1a and 1b are stored in plot_1a.pdf and plot_1b.pdf respectively.

## Question 2
Using Laguerre's method and synthetic division, the roots of an 'n' degree polynomial is found.
